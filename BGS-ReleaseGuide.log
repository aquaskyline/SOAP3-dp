While a release is stable enough or a major enhancement is included in the latest code.
A release should be branched to file:///repo/gpubwt/releases/

For beta release software, the versioning should be RXXX where XXX is the revision number in SubVersion.

E.g. TO release a R39 BGS
svn copy -m "Releasing BGS R39" file:///repo/gpubwt/latest/ file:///repo/gpubwt/releases/R39

To retrieve software from given revision.
E.g. TO obtain R49 software
svn export -r 49 file:///repo/gpubwt/latest/ ../R49/
